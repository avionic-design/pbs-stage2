+ Allow creating a build chroot, which has all the build tools in /core or
  /tools. This would allow maximum isolation from the build system.

  The binutils --lib-path and gcc's specs file probably needs to make the
  linker use libraries and loader from /tools, not /core. /core is supposed
  to build /tools, but not be shipped with a final tarball or anything.

+ Add support for building in a clean build chroot (f.e. debootstrap chroot).

+ Add automatic inter-package dependency handling.

+ Enable building of static compiler libraries
  (toolchains/packages/gcc/Makefile, --enable-static)

  It looks like icedtea/OpenJDK may require this, but it can possibly be
  worked around by patching the OpenJDK sources. grep the OpenJDK sources for
  STATIC_LIBCXX or something like that.

+ Remove VIRTUAL_PROVIDES and VIRTUAL_* hacks from Kconfig. Virtual packages
  can be provided by selecting the providing packages from the virtual package
  like this:

	config PACKAGE_DEVEL_LIBC
		bool "C runtime library"
		select PACKAGE_DEVEL_GLIBC if GLIBC
		select PACKAGE_DEVEL_KLIBC if KLIBC
		select PACKAGE_DEVEL_UCLIBC if UCLIBC
		default n

  For VIRTUAL_KERNEL_LINUX_LIBC something like this should be possible:

	config PACKAGE_KERNEL_LINUX_LIBC
		bool "Linux kernel headers"
		select PACKAGE_KERNEL_LINUX_KERNEL
		default n

  This is mostly implemented now, so t should be safe to remove the special
  handling for VIRTUAL_PROVIDES from scripts/kconfig.

+ Add additional functionality to fetch tarballs from a local proxy. This
  prevents problems when an upstream mirror is down or (re)moves content.

+ When uClibc gets proper TLS support, remove any related workarounds:
    * core/e2fsprogs

+ Implement platform-specific overlay for packages. For example, if a Makefile
  (or Kbuild, or whatever the name) exists in a subdirectory below the
  platforms/<foo>/overlay directory, it will be included after the original
  Makefile of the package and allowed to override variables.

+ Fix the following packages (they don't build correctly on ArchLinux):
    * packages/desktop/icons/hicolor: Seems to hang in an infinite loop
      trying to run autoconf all the time

+ Add wrapper script around toolchain gcc to check that --sysroot is always
  set and that no -I or -L options point to anything outside the sysroot.

+ Build autoconf and automake as part of the toolchain, so that specific
  versions will always be available.

+ Enable libssp support in GCC (currently breaks glibc-based platforms).

+ Add support for package revisions. This should follow the standards set by
  major distributions by incrementing the REVISION variable. Such a method is
  useful to distinguish versions with different patch sets. As a nice side-
  effect, this will cause automatic rebuilds because the package's Makefile
  is modified.

+ Add minimal package manager to keep track of installed packages and files.
  Integrate some even smaller version of that package manager with the root
  filesystem to retrieve a list of installed packages (and perhaps files) at
  runtime.

+ Split up the vendor/nvidia/tegra2/l4t package to allow more fine grained
  control over what components to select (OpenGL ES, OpenMAX, ...). They
  should also ship pkg-config files that are compatible with those provided
  by the libs/mesa package.

+ Provide development files in the OpenGL ES and OpenMAX packages based on
  the NVIDIA Vibrante releases.

+ Move the packages/ti directory into packages/vendor. Move the net/rum and
  net/remote-control packages into packages/vendor/avionic-design.

+ Make packages/kernel/linux a normal package such that it can easily be
  used to build releases (from tarball, git checkout, ...).
