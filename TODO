+ The binutils --lib-path and gcc's specs file probably needs to make the
  linker use libraries and loader from /tools, not /core. /core is supposed
  to build /tools, but not be shipped with a final tarball or anything.

+ Add package-binary target to build binary packages. (Install into different
  ROOTFS, then tar that directory up). <package>-<version>_<arch>.tar.bz2?

  make install can then check whether a binary package exists and use it
  instead of rebuilding the package.

+ Add support for building in a clean build chroot (f.e. debootstrap chroot).
