	  socat is a relay for bidirectional data transfer between two
	  independent data channels.  Each of these data channels may be a file,
	  pipe, device (serial line etc. or a pseudo terminal), a socket (UNIX,
	  IP4, IP6 - raw, UDP, TCP), an SSL socket, proxy CONNECT connection, a
	  file descriptor (stdin etc.), the GNU line editor (readline), a
	  program, or a combination of two of these.
