Subject: [PATCH 2/2] build: Fix out-of-tree build of rdoff

The tools in rdoff/ include compile.h, from the top source directory,
which in turn include "config.h". However in the in the case of
out-of-tree build config.h is in the build directory, so it is missing
from the include path. Add .. to the include path to workaround this
problem.
