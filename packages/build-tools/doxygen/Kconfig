	  Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation
	  from annotated C++ sources, but it also supports other popular
	  programming languages such as C, Objective-C, C-Sharp, PHP, Java,
	  Python, IDL (Corba, Microsoft, and UNO/OpenOffice flavors), Fortran,
	  VHDL, Tcl, and to some extent D.
