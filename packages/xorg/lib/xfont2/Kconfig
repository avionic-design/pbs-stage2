	  libXfont provides the core of the legacy X11 font system, handling the
	  index files (fonts.dir, fonts.alias, fonts.scale), the various font
	  file formats, and rasterizing them.   It is used by the X servers, the
	  X Font Server (xfs), and some font utilities (bdftopcf for instance),
	  but should not be used by normal X11 clients.  X11 clients access
	  fonts via either the new API's in libXft, or the legacy API's in
	  libX11.
