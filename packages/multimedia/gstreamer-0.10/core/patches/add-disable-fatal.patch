Subject: build: add --disable-fatal-warnings configure option

It's reasonable to build from git, but not want to turn all compiler
warnings into fatal errors.  For example, GNOME's jhbuild helps people
get newer versions of software than came from their distribution, but
they may not necessarily want to hack on it.
