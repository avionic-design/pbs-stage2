Subject: [PATCH] Substitute ACLOCAL_MACOS_FLAGS as shell variable

The $(ACLOCAL_MACOS_FLAGS) syntax for substituting only works if it is
actually run through make. However, the autotools use ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS as
is and provide them as command line flags for automake, which will
result in $(...) causing the shell to try and run the non-existing
ACLOCAL_MACOS_FLAGS command.
