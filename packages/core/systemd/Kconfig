	  systemd is a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with SysV and
	  LSB init scripts. systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities,
	  uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand
	  starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups, supports
	  snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and
	  automount points and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based
	  service control logic. It can work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
