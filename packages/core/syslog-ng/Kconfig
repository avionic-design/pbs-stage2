	  syslog-ng, as the name shows, is a syslogd replacement, but with new
	  functionality for the new generation. The original syslogd allows
	  messages only to be sorted based on priority/facility pairs; syslog-ng
	  adds the possibility to filter based on message contents using regular
	  expressions. The new configuration scheme is intuitive and powerful.
	  Forwarding logs over TCP and remembering all forwarding hops makes it
	  ideal for firewalled environments.
