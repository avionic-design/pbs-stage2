	  The EventLog library aims to be a replacement of the simple syslog
	  API provided on UNIX systems. The major difference between EventLog
	  and syslog is that EventLog tries to add structure to messages.
	  EventLog provides an interface to build, format and output an event
	  record. The exact format and output method can be customized by the
	  administrator via a configuration file. This package is the runtime
	  part of the library.
