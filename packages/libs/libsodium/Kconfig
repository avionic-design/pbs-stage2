	  Sodium is a modern, easy-to-use software library for encryption,
	  decryption, signatures, password hashing and more. It is a portable,
	  cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of NaCl, with a
	  compatible API, and an extended API to improve usability even further.
	  Its goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build
	  higher-level cryptographic tools.
