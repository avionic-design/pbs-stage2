	  Cogl is a modern 3D graphics API with associated utility APIs designed to expose the
	  features of 3D graphics hardware using a more object oriented design than OpenGL.
	  The library has primarily been driven by the practical needs of Clutter but it is not
	  tied to any one toolkit or even constrained to developing UI toolkits.
