	  Libsoup is an HTTP library implementation in C. It was originally part
	  of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation called Soup, but
	  the SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been split into separate packages.

	  libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK
	  applications. This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
	  on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
	  the Gtk+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
	  supported for those who want it).
