	  etherdump is an extremely small packet sniffer. It can be used to dump raw
	  ethernet frames for parsing (optimally with Ethereal's text2pcap), or for
	  viewing the network traffic of a few common TCP/IP protocols. On a uClibc
	  system a dynamically-linked version is about 8kB and a statically linked
	  version is about 30kB because it does not depend on libpcap.
