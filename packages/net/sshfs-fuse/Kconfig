	  This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer Protocol.
	  Since most SSH servers already support this protocol it is very easy to set
	  up: i.e. on the server side there's nothing to do.  On the client side
	  mounting the filesystem is as easy as logging into the server with ssh.
