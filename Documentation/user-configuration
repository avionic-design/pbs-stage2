Users can configure PBS behaviour in one of three files: /etc/pbs.mk,
~/.pbs.mk and pbs.mk in the PBS source tree.

Boolean options are enabled by setting them to the value "y" (without the
double-quotes).

The following is a list of supported variables:

	CCACHE
		Setting this to "ccache" enables ccache support. This can
		significantly decrease build times if packages need to be
		rebuilt.

		A cache size of several GiB is recommended.

	ROOTFS_MOUNT_TMPFS
		Enabling this option causes the final root filesystem image
		or initial ramdisk to be created in a temporary (RAM-based)
		filesystem. This can speed up the process because of reduced
		disk I/O but it also has the disadvantage of requiring super
		user permissions for the mount operation.
