Users can configure PBS behaviour in one of three files: /etc/pbs.mk,
~/.pbs.mk and pbs.mk in the PBS source tree.

In order for options to become globally available, you need to export them
using make's "export" keyword. Boolean options are enabled by setting them
to the value "y" (without the double-quotes).

The following is a list of supported variables:

	CCACHE
		Setting this to "ccache" enables ccache support. This can
		significantly decrease build times if packages need to be
		rebuilt.

		A cache size of several GiB is recommended.

	INITRD_MOUNT_TMPFS
		Enabling this option causes the initial ramdisk to be created
		in a temporary (RAM-based) filesystem. This can speed up the
		process because of reduced disk I/O but it also has the
		disadvantage of requiring super user permissions for the
		mount operation.

	ROOTFS_MOUNT_TMPFS
		Enabling this option causes the final root filesystem image
		to be created in a temporary (RAM-based) filesystem. This can
		speed up the process because of reduced disk I/O but it also
		has the disadvantage of requiring super user permissions for
		the mount operation.

	TOOLCHAIN_BASE_PATH
		The default is set to <pbsdir>/toolchains. But you can also
		use a different toolchain.
