Users can configure PBS behaviour in one of three files: /etc/pbs.mk,
~/.pbs.mk and pbs.mk in the PBS source tree (checkout directory).

In order for options to become globally available, you need to export them
using make's "export" keyword. Boolean options are enabled by setting them
to the value "y" (without the double-quotes).

The following is a list of supported variables:

	CCACHE
		Setting this to "ccache" enables ccache support. This can
		significantly decrease build times if packages need to be
		rebuilt.

		A cache size of several GiB is recommended.

	CCACHE_DIR
		Path to cached files for ccache. Defaults to <pbsdir>/ccache
		but can (and should) be overridden if ccache is used for other
		projects as well.

	INITRD_MOUNT_TMPFS
		Enabling this option causes the initial ramdisk to be created
		in a temporary (RAM-based) filesystem. This can speed up the
		process because of reduced disk I/O but it also has the
		disadvantage of requiring super user permissions for the
		mount operation.

	TOOLCHAIN_BASE_PATH
		Must be set to the toplevel directory of your toolchain, even
		if you use the one generated by PBS stage 1. Currently there
		is a default value set pointing to <pbsdir>/toolchains, but
		this behaviour may be dropped soon - do not rely on the
		existence of a default value!

	GIT_REFERENCE_DIR
		Setting this variable allow using a local git cache to speedup
		cloning from remote repositories. This variable must be set to
		to the path of the git cache directory to use.

		A git cache is just a normal repository, but as no working tree
		is needed a bare repository can be used:

			$ mkdir ~/git-cache
			$ cd ~/git-cache
			$ git init --bare

		Then add the repositories that need to be cached:

			$ git remote add kernel git://git.kernel.org/...
			$ git remote add ...

		And fetch the packs from the repositories:

			$ git fetch --all

		The cache is then ready to use, you might also want to setup
		a cron job to regularly update your cache repository.
