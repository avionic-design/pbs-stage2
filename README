Building a platform:
--------------------

To build a platform, enter the following command:

	$ make platform=<platform-name> install

Where <platform-name> is the path below the platform subdirectory of the
platform you wish to build (e.g. platform=add-abox/initrd).

A rootfs subdirectory will be created where all the software for the selected
platform will be installed.


Building a toolchain:
---------------------

Toolchains are sort of "special" platforms. They are located in the
platform/toolchain subdirectory. They are built in the same way as other
platforms.

If for instance you want to build a uClibc-based platform for the Xscale, run
the following command:

	$ make platform=toolchain/arm-xscale-linux-uclibc install
