What is PBS:
------------

PBS is the Platform Build System. It is a set of scripts that automatically
build a defined set of software packages that can be installed in a root
filesystem or as an initial ramdisk.

PBS builds everything from source. To do this, it downloads software tarballs
from the internet and runs the contained build system to configure, build and
install each package.

The source tree contains the following directories:

	* arch: Architecture-specific definitions.
	* checksums: Checksum files to verify downloaded files against.
	* download: Destination directory for downloaded files.
	* packages: Package build scripts.
	* platforms: Platform build scripts.
	* scripts: PBS-related scripts and makefiles.
	* support: Miscellaneous support files.
	* toolchains: Cross-compilation toolchains.

In order to keep this tree clean, platforms should be built in separate build
directories. Typically, such a build directory would reside below the build
subdirectory in the source tree.

By passing the path (absolute or relative) to the build directory in the "O"
(output) variable, the PBS will know where to put temporary files.

Packages and platforms:
-----------------------

A package is any software component that can be built in an automated way.

A platform is a collection of packages and some additional files and scripts
to complete the root filesystem.

Configuring a platform:
-----------------------

A platform can be configured with the following command:

	$ make O=<build directory> menuconfig

When this command executes, it shows a dialog where the target hardware can be
configured and individual packages be selected for later inclusion in the root
filesystem.

PBS uses Kconfig to allow easy selection of software packages that are to be
built. Based on this configuration it generates a dependency list to make sure
that packets are built in the correct order.

Building a platform:
--------------------

Build a platform is done with the following command:

	$ make O=<build directory>

Where <build directory> is the directory where you already ran the menuconfig
command.

A subdirectory (rootfs) will be created where all the software for the
selected platform will be installed. Binary packages will also be created and
later installed to a root filesystem with more fine-grained control.

Building a toolchain:
---------------------

Toolchains are sort of "special" platforms. They are located in the toolchains
subdirectory and are already pre-configured.

To build a toolchain for the ARM architecture and uClibc support with the
EABI, use the following command:

	$ make O=toolchains/arm-unknown-linux-uclibceabi

A utility script exists which can be used for toolchain batch builds and also
archives the toolchain binaries for later use, or for deployment on other
systems. The script is "toolchains/build-toolchains". It reads lines of
toolchain names from standard input and builds the corresponding toolchain.
It keeps a log of all activities in "logs/<toolchain>.log". After the build is
finished, an tarball with the tools built can be found in "toolchains/archive"
(named after the toolchain and the binutils, gcc, Linux kernel and libc
versions). The script will automatically clean up after the build, so that
only the finished cross-compile tools remain in the "usr" subdirectory of the
toolchain base "toolchains/<toolchain>".

	$ echo arm-unknown-linux-uclibceabi | sh toolchains/build-toolchains

To completely remove a built toolchain, the "clean" command line argument can
be passed to the script:

	$ echo bfin-linux-uclibc | sh toolchains/build-toolchains clean

This will completely remove any temporary files and also the finished
binaries.

A list of all available toolchains can be obtained by running the
"toolchains/list-toolchains" script, which doesn't do much more than just list
the subdirectories in "toolchains" that contain toolchain configuration files.
The output of this script can be piped to the "build-toolchains" script to
build all available toolchains:

	$ sh toolchains/list-toolchains | sh toolchains/build-toolchains

Note that this may take a very long time to complete. A single toolchain needs
about 2 hours to build on a 2 GHz Intel Dual-Core machine.

Of course, all toolchains can also be remove like this:

	$ sh toolchains/list-toolchains | sh toolchains/build-toolchains clean

If you only want to build i686 toolchains, you could do something like this:

	$ sh toolchains/list-toolchains | grep '^i686' | \
		toolchains/build-toolchains


Packages:
---------

Packages in PBS are defined in the packages directory. They are categorized
by placing them into subdirectories.
To define a new packages, create a new directory with the name of the new
package in packages folder.
In order to build the package we need two files. The first one is a Kconfig
file. It will define the config variable for the package and is responsible
for dependeny tracking. The second file is the Makefile which defines the
actual build process.
To simplify package definition we have several predefined profiles. The most
common and recommended type of packages is auto-tools based (include
package/autotools.mk).
Once you're done with Makefile and Kconfig, you have to update the Kconfig and
Makefile of the parrent directory. Otherwise the new package is not known.
Finally you'll need to update one of the checksum files (usually sha256).


Build Process:
--------------

Each package is build in several steps. Each steps is marked complete with
stamp files created in the build directory. At the end of the build process
the following files are exist:
	.directory
	.chksum-<tarball>
	.checksum
	.extract-<tarball>
	.extract
	.setup
	.patch
	.configure
	.build                - Build the package
	.do-install           - 
	.prune                - Prune marked files
	.strip                - Strip the marked files
	.cleanup              - 
	.binary               - Create binary packages
	.install              - Install in sysroot dir
